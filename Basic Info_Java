1. Use "Sysout " + ctrl + space to print " System.out.println( ) ; "  in Eclipse.

2. For "for-each loop" , iteration value be the next element in the collection .
        Syntax :
                         for(type itr_var : collection)
                            stmt-block
        Example :
                            ary[ ] = { 1,5,4,2 }
                             then for 1st itr. itr_val will be 1
                                           2nd itr. itr_val will be 5
                                           3rd itr. itr_val will be 4
                                           .
                                           .
                                           and so on

3. In JAVA by default class members are in Default access not in Public (Opp. to C++ ) .

4. Using Terminal commands
                 mousepad  main()_class_name.java
                 javac main()_class_name.java            //To compile
                 java main()_class_name
